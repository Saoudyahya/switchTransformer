# SwitchTransformer

## Overview

The SwitchTransformer is an implementation of a neural network architecture that combines the concepts of mixture of experts and transformers. This model leverages multiple expert layers to efficiently process input sequences, allowing for dynamic routing of information through various neural network experts.

## Features

- **Mixture of Experts**: The model uses a gating mechanism to select which expert to use for each input, enabling efficient computation and improved expressiveness.
- **Multi-Head Self-Attention**: Each expert is built upon a multi-head self-attention mechanism, allowing the model to capture complex dependencies in the input data.
- **Output Layer**: The output of the model is transformed into token logits, which can be decoded into human-readable text using a tokenizer.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- PyTorch 1.7.0+
- Hugging Face Transformers library

## Installation

To install the necessary packages, you can use pip:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision transformers

```
## Usage
Importing the Model
You can import the SwitchTransformer class and use it in your application as follows:

```python
import torch
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModel

# Initialize the model and tokenizer
model_name = "bert-base-uncased"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
hidden_size = 768
num_experts = 4
num_heads = 8

model = SwitchTransformer(num_experts, hidden_size=hidden_size, num_heads=num_heads)


```
## Running the Model
To run the model on a sample input text, you can follow these steps:


```python
input_text = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."

# Tokenize the input text
tokens = tokenizer(input_text, return_tensors='pt', padding=True, truncation=True)

# Pass the tokenized input through the model
with torch.no_grad():
    embeddings = AutoModel.from_pretrained(model_name)(**tokens).last_hidden_state  # Get BERT embeddings
    output = model(embeddings)

# Decode the output logits to text
decoded_ids = torch.argmax(output, dim=-1)  # Get the most likely token IDs
decoded_output = tokenizer.decode(decoded_ids[0].tolist(), skip_special_tokens=True)

print("Decoded output:", decoded_output)


```
## Example Output
The model will produce an output shape and decoded text. An example might look like this:


```python
Output shape: torch.Size([1, 12, 768])
Decoded output: The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.

```
