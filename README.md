# SwitchTransformer

## Overview

The SwitchTransformer is an implementation of a neural network architecture that combines the concepts of mixture of experts and transformers. This model leverages multiple expert layers to efficiently process input sequences, allowing for dynamic routing of information through various neural network experts.

## Features

- **Mixture of Experts**: The model uses a gating mechanism to select which expert to use for each input, enabling efficient computation and improved expressiveness.
- **Multi-Head Self-Attention**: Each expert is built upon a multi-head self-attention mechanism, allowing the model to capture complex dependencies in the input data.
- **Output Layer**: The output of the model is transformed into token logits, which can be decoded into human-readable text using a tokenizer.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- PyTorch 1.7.0+
- Hugging Face Transformers library

## Installation

To install the necessary packages, you can use pip:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision transformers
